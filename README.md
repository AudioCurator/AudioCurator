# AudioCurator
Open source audio blog platform

##-A passion for music-

The main purpose for AudioCurator was to create an easy-to-implement template for anyone who would like to curate, comment on, and post their own selection of music to share with their personal audiences. The template can operate as a standalone blog, or linked to from a personal site. 

Finding streaming audio player templates that were free and well documented proved to be a diffuclt task. 

Keeping it free and open source, our audio player can stream directly from any user-created playlist on their own SoundCloud and can pull any track from the SoundCloud universe. 

We hope you enjoy AudioCurator, feel free to tweak the code as you like, add your own flair, and contact us with questions of comments.
